# Portfolio: Advanced CSS


This is a portfolio project.  It includes a navigation bar (navbar) at the top of the screen with links to each of the portfolio sections, i.e., about me, work, and contact and resume that when clicked, will move the focus to the corresponding section on the page.  It includes a hero banner image, and a subtitle within the hero banner image.  

The navbar hover effects: the navbar items' background transitions up and behind the text and the font color and background color are reversed.  Work section hover effects: background image of the work sections' opacity is reduced on hover. 

Page was designed using semantic html tags for the page's organizational layout and to make it accessible.  Several multilayered flex box elements for the work, about me, and contact sections of the page were used to make the page functional.    

Finally, media queries were used along with the flex box elements to make the page responsive, so that the items change size depending on the user's screen size.  For smaller screens and mobile devices, items in the work and contact section will stack into a single column and centered on the page.
